            <p><strong>Tomato Dream</strong> is an artistic project by Marina Woisky and Pedro Nascimento that articulates performance, site-specific practice, and culinary processes around the tomato as its primary ingredient. The work departs from this fruit—widely present and disseminated within food culture—to displace it from its utilitarian field and activate it as an aesthetic and narrative device.</p>
            
            <p>The choice of the tomato is not incidental. Beyond traversing the artists’ individual histories and their shared experience as a couple, it carries a transcontinental trajectory: originating in South America, it was appropriated, re-signified, and incorporated into different cultures, becoming an identity symbol in distinct contexts, such as in Italy.</p>
            
            <p>The work is structured as a banquet developed through the investigation of tomato varieties and engagement with local producers. From this research, the artists construct a menu in which the tomato is amplified across its multiple forms, textures, and preparations. In this context, the tomato ceases to function merely as an ingredient and begins to operate as plastic, chromatic, and sensorial matter.</p>
            
            <p>Prepared and served by the artists themselves, the banquet becomes a relational gesture. By tensioning the boundaries between art and gastronomy, <strong>Tomato Dream</strong> inserts food into the symbolic field. The experience is collective and situated: the audience does not merely observe, but participates in an event unfolding in time, activating conviviality and shared exchange.</p>
